# Auto-File-Sorter
This script auto sorts your files, takes in a path to the unsorted/input folder and a path to the sorted/output folder. Has an option to add file extensions if not supported & file can be reset to default

Check out my ```Random File Creator.py``` in the ```Random_Projects``` Repository if you want dummy files to test the script
